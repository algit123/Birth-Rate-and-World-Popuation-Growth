Birth Rate and World Population Growth


Project Purpose:

The world population now exceeds 7 billion people, up from around 3 billion in 1960. So It has more than doubled in the last 50 years. This exponential rate of growth is not sustainable over the long term. With a very limited amount of resources (water, arable land, living areas, energy sources, etc.) to share, our planet Earth can simply not sustain such an explosive population. Many believe that it will lead to an acute crisis at some point in the future, as an overflowing population struggles to cope.

Some argue however that this doomsday scenario will not materialize because the world population will level off and even decline as the world develops, thanks to a sharp decline in birth rate. They contend that when people get richer, they bear fewer children. Therefore, developing nations (which account for most of the world population growth) will see their populations plateau or decline as they develop.

In this mini-project, we want to see if this argument is backed up by the data. Looking at the World Bank’s “World’s Development Indicators” dataset available on Kaggle, we want to find out how much different parts of the world have been developing, how fast their birthrate has been falling, and how much that has affected the overall population growth over the last 50 years.



Project Deliverables and Inputs:

Available in this repository are:
•	The project report (PowerPoint presentation),
•	The Jupyter notebook used to explore and assess the data, and

The “World Development indicators” dataset is available on Kaggle and was not copied because of its large size.
